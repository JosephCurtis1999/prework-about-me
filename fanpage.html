    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
    Avelino, hailing from North London, is arguably the greatest lyricist coming from the UK.
    His slick bars separate him from a crowd of rappers who rely on autotune and generic lyrics.
    In a recent freestyle he can be quoted saying "They call me silver surfer because they marvel
    at me flowing". This is a reference to the way the silver surfer flows through the air on his
    surfboard, referencing how his delivery on a beat is so smooth based on the recognition he 
    receives from fans and listeners.
